✏️ The <input> Tag — What’s It Doing?
The <input> tag is used to create interactive fields inside a form — things the user can type into or click on, like text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Google</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <p>Search the web using Google!</p>
      <input type="text" /><br>   <!--This creates a text box where the user can type something.-->
      <input type="submit" value="Google Search" />   <!-- This creates a submit button, type="submit" tells the browser: "When clicked, submit the form.", value="Google Search" is what shows on the button.-->
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
🧠 So What Happens ?
The user types something in the first box.

Then clicks the second input (the "Google Search" button).

The form would normally send that input somewhere (to a server or a URL) — but this example doesn’t include that part yet.
